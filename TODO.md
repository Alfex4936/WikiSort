To do
=================

The original version included a full test suite for generating arrays with various properties (random, mostly ascending, mostly descending, all equivalent, in order, reverse order, etc. etc.) and timing and verifying the correctness, but it was left out from this version as it uses a large number of dependencies. A self-contained benchmark and test tool would be very useful.

At the moment, mostly-descending is noticeably slower than mostly-ascending. This algorithm would benefit from the following addition:

    #define bzSort(array, array_count, compare) { \
       __typeof__(array[0]) temp, *bzSort_array = array; const long bzSort_count = array_count; \
       uint64 i, ascending = 0, descending = 0; \
       for (i = 1; i < bzSort_count; i++) if (compare(bzSort_array[i], bzSort_array[i - 1]) >= 0) ascending++; else descending++; \
       if (descending > ascending) { reverse(bzSort_array); swap(ascending, descending); } \
       if (bzSort_count < 32) { \
          /* insertion sort the array */ \
          [...] \
       } else if (descending > 0) { \

However, a na√Øve array reverse operation would invalidate the stability of the algorithm:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[5 a] [5 b] [4 c]  <--->  [4 c] <b>[5 b] [5 a]</b>

A more-intelligent reversal that maintains the order of equivalent elements is needed before this can be added to the algorithm. Another possibility is simply copying-and-pasting a slightly-modified version of the algorithm that runs if descending > ascending, which is optimized for arrays whose elements are mostly in descending order.
