Chapter 2: Merging
=============

<b>Standard merge sort</b><br/>
Merge sorting works by breaking an array into two halves, over and over again, until the size of each half is below some threshold. For a threshold of 2 this means simply swapping the two items in that part of the array if they are out of order. For a larger threshold you could use an insertion sort or something. Once we have sorted two halves of the array, we have to <i>merge</i> them together to arrive at the final sorted array.<br/>

    MergeSort(array, range)
        if (range.length == 2)
            if (array[range.start] > array[range.end]) Swap(array[range.start], array[range.end])
        else if (range.length > 2)
            mid = range.start + range.length/2
            MergeSort(array, MakeRange(range.start, mid))
            MergeSort(array, MakeRange(mid, range.end))
            Merge(array, MakeRange(range.start, mid), MakeRange(mid, range.end))

<br/><br/>
<b>Standard merge</b><br/>
The merge operation of the merge sort algorithm takes two arrays that <i>are already sorted</i>, and combines them into a single array containing A and B sorted together. The operation is acutally quite simple: just take the smaller of the two values at the start of A and B and add it to the final array. Once A and B are empty, the final array is completed!<br/>

    Merge(array, A, B)
        Copy A and B into a buffer
        A_count = 0, B_count = 0, insert = 0
        while (A_count < A.length && B_count < B.length)
            if (buffer[A_count] <= buffer[B.start + B_count])
                array[A.start + insert] = buffer[A_count]
                A_count = A_count + 1
            else
                array[A.start + insert] = buffer[B.start + B_count]
                B_count = B_count + 1
            insert = insert + 1
        Copy the remaining part of the buffer back into the array

Here's an example of how it works:
    
    1. we want to merge these two arrays, A and B:
    [0 2 4 7]  [1 3 7 8]
    []
    
    2. 0 is smaller
    [2 4 7]  [1 3 7 8]
    [0]
    
    3. 1 is smaller
    [2 4 7]  [3 7 8]
    [0 1]
    
    4. 2 is smaller
    [4 7]  [3 7 8]
    [0 1 2]
    
    5. 3 is smaller
    [4 7]  [7 8]
    [0 1 2 3]
    
    6. 4 is smaller
    [7]  [7 8]
    [0 1 2 3 4]
    
    7. 7 and 7 are equal, so give precedence to A
    []  [7 8]
    [0 1 2 3 4 7]
    
    8. A is empty, so just add the rest of B to the end
    [] []
    [0 1 2 3 4 7 7 8]

<br/><br/>
<b>Problems</b><br/>
There are some significant drawbacks to this design, especially if you're concerned about memory usage. The recursion actually uses O(log n) stack space, and the merge operation requires a separate buffer that's the same size as the original array.<br/>

Can we do better? <b>Of course!</b><br/><br/>


<b>Merge sort without recursion</b><br/>
To remove the recursion, we can use what's called a <a href="http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Merge_sort#Bottom-up_merge_sort">bottom-up merge sort</a>. Here's what it looks like for an array of a size that happens to be a power of two:<br/>

    MergeSort(array, count)
        for (length = 1; length < count; length = length * 2)
            for (merge = 0; merge < count; merge = merge + length * 2)
                start = merge
                mid = merge + length
                end = merge + length * 2
                
                Merge(array, MakeRange(start, mid), MakeRange(mid, end))

For an array of size 16, it does this (the operation is shown to the right):

                                       [ 15  2   13  7   3   0   11  4   12  6   10  14  1   9   8   5  ]
    merge 0-0 and 1-1                  [[15][2 ] 13  7   3   0   11  4   12  6   10  14  1   9   8   5  ]
    merge 2-2 and 3-3                  [ 2   15 [13][7 ] 3   0   11  4   12  6   10  14  1   9   8   5  ]
    merge 4-4 and 5-5                  [ 2   15  7   13 [3 ][0 ] 11  4   12  6   10  14  1   9   8   5  ]
    merge 6-6 and 7-7                  [ 2   15  7   13  0   3  [11][4 ] 12  6   10  14  1   9   8   5  ]
    merge 8-8 and 9-9                  [ 2   15  7   13  0   3   4   11 [12][6 ] 10  14  1   9   8   5  ]
    merge 10-10 and 11-11              [ 2   15  7   13  0   3   4   11  6   12 [10][14] 1   9   8   5  ]
    merge 12-12 and 13-13              [ 2   15  7   13  0   3   4   11  6   12  10  14 [1 ][9 ] 8   5  ]
    merge 14-14 and 15-15              [ 2   15  7   13  0   3   4   11  6   12  10  14  1   9  [8 ][5 ]]
    merge 0-1 and 2-3                  [[2   15][7   13] 0   3   4   11  6   12  10  14  1   9   5   8  ]
    merge 4-5 and 6-7                  [ 2   7   13  15 [0   3 ][4   11] 6   12  10  14  1   9   5   8  ]
    merge 8-9 and 10-11                [ 2   7   13  15  0   3   4   11 [6   12][10  14] 1   9   5   8  ]
    merge 12-13 and 14-15              [ 2   7   13  15  0   3   4   11  6   10  12  14 [1   9 ][5   8 ]]
    merge 0-3 and 4-7                  [[2   7   13  15][0   3   4   11] 6   10  12  14  1   5   8   9  ]
    merge 8-11 and 12-15               [ 0   2   3   4   7   11  13  15 [6   10  12  14][1   5   8   9 ]]
    merge 0-7 and 8-15                 [[0   2   3   4   7   11  13  15][1   5   6   8   9   10  12  14 ]
                                       [ 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15 ]
Which is of course exactly what we wanted. Note that it starts off by merging chunks of size 1, then size 2, then size 4, and finally size 8.<br/><br/>

<b>To extend this logic to non-power-of-two sizes</b>, we floor the size down to the nearest power of two for these calculations, then scale back again to get the ranges to merge.

    MergeSort(array, count)
        power_of_two = FloorPowerOfTwo(count)
        fractional_base = power_of_two/16
        fractional_step = size % fractional_base (modulus, which gets the remainder from size/fractional_base)
        decimal_step = floor(size/fractional_base)
        
        for (length = 16; length < power_of_two; length = length * 2)
            decimal = fractional = 0
            while (decimal < size)
                start = decimal
                
                decimal = decimal + decimal_step
                fractional = fractional + fractional_step
                if (fractional >= fractional_base)
                    fractional = fractional - fractional_base
                    decimal = decimal + 1
                
                mid = decimal
                
                decimal = decimal + decimal_step
                fractional = fractional + fractional_step
                if (fractional >= fractional_base)
                    fractional = fractional - fractional_base
                    decimal = decimal + 1
                
                end = decimal
                
                Merge(array, MakeRange(start, mid), MakeRange(mid, end))

This is considerably more involved, <b>but it guarantees that the two ranges being merged will always have the same size to within one item</b>, which ends up being about 10% faster than the standard bottom-up merge sort.<br/>

==========================

This removes the need for the O(log n) stack space! Although, to be fair, that wasn't really an issue â€“ sorting 1.5 million items only recurses ~20 times anyway. The real problem is that O(n) for the separate buffer! What can we do about <i>that</i>?<br/><br/><br/>


<b>Merging using a half-size buffer</b><br/>
One obvious optimization is to only copy the values from A into the buffer, since by the time we run the risk of overwriting values in the range of B we will have already read and compared those values. Here's what this variant looks like:<br/>

    Merge(array, A, B)
        Copy the values from A into the buffer, but leave B where it is
        A_count = 0, B_count = 0, insert = 0
        while (A_count < A.length && B_count < B.length)
            if (buffer[A_count] <= array[B.start + B_count])
                array[A.start + insert] = buffer[A_count]
                A_count = A_count + 1
            else
                array[A.start + insert] = array[B.start + B_count]
                B_count = B_count + 1
            insert = insert + 1
        Copy the remaining part of the buffer back into the array

<br/><br/>
<b>Merging without overwriting the contents of the half-size buffer</b><br/>
Finally, if instead of assigning values we <i>swap</i> them to and from the buffer, we end up with a merge operation that still requires extra space, but doesn't overwrite any of the values that were stored in that extra space:<br/>

    Merge(array, A, B)
        Block swap the values in A with those in the buffer
        A_count = 0, B_count = 0, insert = 0
        while (A_count < A.length && B_count < B.length)
            if (buffer[A_count] <= array[B.start + B_count])
                Swap(array[A.start + insert], buffer[A_count])
                A_count = A_count + 1
            else
                Swap(array[A.start + insert], array[B.start + B_count])
                B_count = B_count + 1
            insert = insert + 1
        Block swap the remaining part of the buffer with the remaining part of the array

The items in the buffer will likely be in a different order afterwards, but at least they're still there.

========================

So now we can efficiently merge A and B without losing any buffer values, but we still need that additional buffer to exist. There isn't much we can do about that... but what if this extra buffer <i>was part of the original array</i>?<br/><br/>


That's the idea behind <a href="https://github.com/BonzaiThePenguin/WikiSort/blob/master/Chapter%203:%20In-Place.md">in-place merging</a>!
