Chapter 4: Helping
=======================

You've <a href="https://github.com/BonzaiThePenguin/WikiSort/blob/master/Chapter%203:%20In-Place.md">read the documentation</a>, you've <a href="https://github.com/BonzaiThePenguin/WikiSort/blob/master/WikiSort.c">downloaded the public domain implementation</a>, and you totally understand how it works? Now what?

Have you thought about adding your own contributions? Sorting is a core operation of pretty much any program ever written, yet there are so few <i>good</i> and <i>documented</i> implementatons out there. Helping improve WikiSort would be a great way to benefit as many developers as possible!
